In this program I call three functions, each using the same function name (overloading), but with different parameters. Each function calcualtes a random number based on the parameters and outputs the random number. The first function has no paramaters and therefore simply calculates the random number generation. The second has an upper limit of variable n2 (which I set to 70) and calculates a random number betwee 1 and n2. The third function has a lower limit of variable n1 along with the same variable n2 as the upper limit and calculates a random number between the two. I tried writing a forloop to calculate the ranged random number in the third function, but I simply need to write a better alogrithm which was much simpler.
