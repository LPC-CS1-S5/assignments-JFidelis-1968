To create this program I used the switch function with 4 cases and a default case. Each of the first three cases asks for user input to generate the variables used in the calculation of the area of each shape, and an if/else statement is used to determine if negative values are used to invalidate the input. Case 4 exits the program and the Default case exits the program for invalid input. Each case displays a text message with the resulting calculation or an error message.
